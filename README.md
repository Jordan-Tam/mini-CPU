A project I made for my Computer Architecture and Organization class. 

Constructed a miniature CPU model using [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution), developed my own instruction set architecture, and coded an assembler using Python to translate programs written in my assembly language into a file readable to the CPU.
